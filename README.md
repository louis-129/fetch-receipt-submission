# fetch-receipt-submission

1. Submission can be run using "go run ." after cd-ing into the folder (runs on port 3000).

2. I've added a test script that uses the two example from the example repo. You can run both tests using "go test". To run an individual test use "go test -run TestProcessReceipt1" or "go test -run TestProcessReceipt2".
